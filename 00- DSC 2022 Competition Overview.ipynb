By holding this competition, We hope to continue encouraging crews to get their hands on data science and cultivate new ways of thinking about problems. This year, we desinged 2 tracks: the **data literacy track** and the **data modeling** track to accomodate participants with various experience level in data science. Regardless of the level at which you start with, we will offer you a great learning experience by guiding you through tackling an exciting business problem step by step. Your adventure starts here..."
